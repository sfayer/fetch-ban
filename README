Fetch-ban Readme
----------------

fetch-ban is a tool for collating a list of banned user DNs and placing them
into the correct places on a given node to ban the users.

The original version of fetch-ban took a list from ARGUS and a static file and
wrote a single ban_users.db file for LCAS. This new version supports input &
output plugins which means ban lists can be fetched from multiple services and
written to one or more files of varying formats. 

The minimum system requirements for fetch-ban are python 3.6 & pyCURL. These
requirements should be met by RHEL7 and above.

See the example config file in /etc/fetch-ban.conf for configuration details.
